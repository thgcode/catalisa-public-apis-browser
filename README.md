# Catalisa-Public-Apis-Browser-Angular

This was my project for the Catalisa challenge from [Zup](https://zup.com.br).
It is an accessible app to browse public APIS from the [public-apis
API](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis). I will add more information
to this file as the project progresses.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.1.3.

## Running the app

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
